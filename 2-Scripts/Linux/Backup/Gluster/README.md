# Scripts

There are multiple scripts here, some will back up multiple bricks reading from two files passed as arguments. (ENd in -MULTI). Some are made to be run as cron jobs and some are simple infinite loops that sleep for a long time (-INF).

I provide a simple script to create a cron job. This **needs** to be edited to work, with the arguemnts for the script.
