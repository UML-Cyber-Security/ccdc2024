# ccdc2024

This repo will be used as a continuation of the previous season's work. We want to continue documenting very well so anyone can read through this stuff and just do the task at hand without any problems. And if they do run into problems, then we want it to be detailed enough to showcase the potential errors.

Scripts, presentation notes, etc. All is fair game in here. Be professional when you submit items you want to use in the competition.
