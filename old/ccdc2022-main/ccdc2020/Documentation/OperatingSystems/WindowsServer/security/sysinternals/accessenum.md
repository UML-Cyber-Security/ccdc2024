# AccessEnum

This tool is a GUI that will quickly enumerate files and registry keys in the specified location. This is useful to get a quick view at where a misconfiguration might have happened, as opposed to something like AccessChk which will give you every object with a particular setting.

## Usage
Add the path to a directory, file, or registry key and click `Scan` on the bottom left of the program.
