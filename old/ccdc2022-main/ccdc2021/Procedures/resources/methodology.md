We talked about some ways to make better use of meeting times.

We identified these areas of improvement:

- Not everyone was working on a product. Should have a mix of passive and active learning.
- The demo wasn't relevant to everyone (Fabrizo had installed the system twice to test my walkthrough)
- The demo used up all the practice time. There wasn't any time left to update the items that Sashank noted could be improved.
- Not enough time was dedicated to improvements/fixing problems (Vlad pointed out the networking didn't work and we fixed it, but I didn't even check before the demo)

New methodology:

- Team members fall into one of 5 categories (based on skills, interest, and need):
    - Networking
    - Linux
    - Windows
    - Testing
    - Scripting

- Demos should be relevant for everyone involved, so we will do two demos at a time each practice and assign members based on specialization to either session. New members will sit with Prof Narain and work on beginner material if  / as they come in late, but current members should not be late. It's disruptive and you won't get the full demo. 

- To improve we need to debrief, discuss improvements as a group, and update our online documentation

- Demo documentation needs to include these items updated in a README.md file:
  - A **Objective**  (Ex: Install Arch Linux)
  - An **End Product** for the demo participants (Ex: A bootable Arch Linux VM in Virtualbox)
  - **Scripting solution** for whatever you demo (If it can be scripted, it should be)
  - **Security analysis** (Ex: This Arch system implements these security controls...)
  - **Testing** (Ex: We test the security / operability with X, Y, and Z test)
  - **Documentation** (Ex: A README.md in the github describing how to install Arch Linux) in the club-demos directory in this repo
  - **ToDo** (Ex: Make the Arch Install into a script, and include home directory encryption)
  - **References** (Ex: I used the Arch Wiki and this website to set things up, and then implemented the controls from this article)

- We may re-run demos with updates if the updates are significant-- for instance, our Arch Installation instructions completed ignore security, so we will likely need to run that again with the security implemented

- To practice our team work, we will start doing group scenarios where we have to work as a team to accomplish objectives, we will debrief these and shouldn't be upset if we can't finish them as we learn and grow together. We will also change active Captains later in the practice season from time to time to give people a chance to see the high level objectives
