# **Three Weeks Until Qualifiers**

## Why Does CCDC Exist?

* To prevent situations like the following:
  * When the Coast Guard was hacked
  * Hospital randsomware attacks

## Purpose and Common Goal

* There are different colored teams:
  * Gold, White, **BLUE**, red

* Why do we care?
  * There is a lot to learn
  * We want to know every aspect of setting up and securing a system
  * CCDC is a great test of our computer skills
  * It also tests our **responsive stress** (Sashank)
  * It will help us prioritize what is most important
  * It will also help us learn to work as a team

* What is the reward for competing in a CCDC competition?
  * Big name companies will be at the event and are looking to recruit students who excel based on their performance during the event
  * Sashank's team won in the past and their networking student exceeded expectations so Cisco gave the student an on the spot interview and hired the student solely based on the competition
  * That student's starting salary was $250K/yr
  * The amount of learning during this event is probably more than our standard four years of college
  * Therefore, we should put in as much work as we can

* The End Result?
  * Our results will demonstrate how much work and effort we put in
  * It is more than just having knowledge of how systems work and knowing information - It is us working together as a team

* During the past semester (Fall 2019), we focused on small group scenarios, which was fine, but now we need to kick it up a knotch and really test ourselves
* Although we are all at different levels, we are still all learning as we progress together
* We will not judge one another for not understanding how to do something, instead we need to help and support each another
* We will be as good as we allow ourselves to be, which means a key factor is **good teamwork**
* The full details of the qualifiers will be known a week from today (so by 1/13/2020)
  * Such as basic detials, know what environments we will be using, some information on the architecture we have to use

  We are good as we allow ourselves to be – good teamwork
  Full details of qualifies a week from now: basic details, how to login to enviro.
  They will give us some information, some architechure, maybe 2 linux boxes 3 windows boxes, whatever firewall they choose – what injects they will ask about
  shashank
  When we start our own recon – we will find out more
  On a Saturday the jan 25 9am -2 pm
  Not entire red team (small percent of red team)
  Our focus should be on very basics: lets get a service up and running quickly – maybe prioritize services
  http dns, web servies, ssh, vpn, -linux
  windows serves, dhcp,
  ssh server
  don’t think like this: not everyone can do everything
  ssh not up and running last time – Shashank
  we don’t have muscle memory down
  these three weeks – not finals
  maybe few days before – dress rehearsal: grace – more info when we get more info about qual
  we can do stuff remotely – on own and together
  3 days out of week to ccdc
  1 in person meeting
  Use team viewer – don’t need vpn
  Need to do a lot of “homework” – scope out a lot of different services
  Fab has a rudimentary to do list
  Sashank: work on scoring engine – basic checks, add some security, ex check for dns but not dns x? ad?
  Next week a good enough sys running for a web brower
  For ex for https – send request get a restonse – “congrad"  prob not scoring functions – sashank trying to add scoring security
  Next couple of weeks
  Docker? – worry about after qualifiers
  Docker -lightweight in resources
  They are gonna give us restricted hardware
  Most – 2 gigs of ram so a docker would be better
  Email server: joel: for qualifier? Non-trivial for a mail server
  For qual : not too hard for security but implement service quickly and functialn – and complete inject – partial points for what we work on
  Ex email server as inject: not complete but show we have something working – maybe give us 60/100 points
  Standard way of incenet report
  We need one for incet report
  If too
  Maybe don’t need all
  Response reports: they all felt it was good but 100/300
  Details more important

  Good documentation comes in here:
  Do we want all linux to be able to handle

  Three teams:
  Windows, linux, networking
  Networking: palo alto – 5 more hrs. finish by this week or tmro,
  Look at pf scense, then go back to cisco
  New your guy said prob palo alto – lets just finish cisco then focus on palo alto

  Linux and windows: hardening
  Lets make sure its up and running this time

  Write inject then pass it around
  Ex ssh import – configure port, pub key,… write, give, then receive someone else inject ( maybe fun?)
  How long to write inject? We receive injects and write reports for qualifiesrs 10 min – 2 hrs

  To write a good test question you have to know what your talking about
  Worth a shot trying this inject activity
  Research
  Maybe one link even,
  Lets organize links
  Slack vs github? Maybe slack better
  Mary: is there a way to share with group like windows share with windows team
  Lets make three channels – related topics to that
  Maybe keyworks instead of channels? – one channel
  How manhy people allowed in qualifier? – no authority
  23 teams total about
  Top 10 make it to regionals
  Next practice – ideally tomorrow
  Under procedures something .md – pick and start researching
  Get up and test every service
  C cleaner
  Make google calender? – calender app in slack
  Update meeteing? – or practice face to face
  Separate group channels?
  Monday meetings?
  Make a new slack ccdc workgroup

  Blue hills hiking – microspikes uml bike shop
